    Welcome. I'm David Nguyen, a computer science major at Texas A&M University, and I will be graduating in 2026. I enjoy coding because it allows me to solve problems creatively and create amazing projects. I love listening to music in my free time. I also love cars because of their cutting-edge technology and imaginative designs. Fashion also interests me because it allows me to express myself through clothes and accessories.
 Additionally, this relates to coding since front-end development lets me use code to express my creativity and who I am when designing websites. I like to use the same creativity with my websites as I do with my clothes, which is why I like to wear unique colors and textures, which help me to come up with ways to apply visual aesthetics while being functional. The crossover between fashion and coding allows me to express myself while showing my technical skills. I am also an adrenaline junkie who is constantly seeking for a new challenge that will push me out of my comfort zone. I love taking on new hobbies like rock climbing, wanting to learn to skydive, or even learning a new language. I thrive on trying new things and taking risks. I truly thrive in opportunities for learning and growth. This drive for improvement constantly fuels my passion, both personally and professionally.Â 
 My interests shape who I am, making me adaptable, creative, and ready to take on any challenge. My unique technical skills and detail-oriented mind make me an asset to any team. I am incredibly optimistic and bring this mentality to each project I work on. In a world of rapid change with the latest technology. I am forward-thinking and prepared to adapt, but more than that, I am ready to challenge change. I'm excited about the future and the contributions that I can contribute to any team. </p>
